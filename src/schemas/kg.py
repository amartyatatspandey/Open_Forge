"""Knowledge Graph schema — Team B owns.

All KGNode creation must use EXTRACTION_METHOD_CONFIDENCE to assign edge confidence.

This module defines the Pydantic models for the Neo4j-backed knowledge graph
that stores canonical design knowledge: physics concepts, component types,
design recipes, placement rules, and their relationships.

The knowledge graph is organized into 5 abstraction layers:
- Layer 1: Physics concepts (Ohm's law, thermal resistance)
- Layer 2: Component types (regulator, capacitor)
- Layer 3: Component instances (TPS62933DRLR, GRM155R71C104KA88D)
- Layer 4: Design recipes ("choose input cap based on ripple current")
- Layer 5: Project-specific placements (actual PCB designs)

Usage:
    from src.schemas.kg import KGNode, KGEdge, EXTRACTION_METHOD_CONFIDENCE
    from src.schemas.datasheet import ExtractionMethod

    confidence = EXTRACTION_METHOD_CONFIDENCE[ExtractionMethod.P1_VECTOR]
